# Data Engineering Track  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of data engineering principles by following a structured workflow involving data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and retrieval. The projectâ€™s purpose is to design a functional data pipeline that stores and transforms data into meaningful structures, showcasing its usability through accessible output formats.  

## Key Features  
- **Database Integration:**  
  Data is stored in a SQL database using PostgresSQL Platform. 

- **ETL Workflow:**  
  Data is extracted from csv files stored in 'resources' directory, transformed to meet predefined requirements, and loaded into the database.  

- **Data Retrieval:**  
  The project enables data retrieval using a method known as Pandas Dataframe.  

- **Additional Data Engineering Library:**  
  Integration of an advanced library known as'PyArrow' has been used for the data exportation.

## Instructions  

### 1. Setup  
- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone <https://github.com/Keegawho198/COVID-19-Data-Engineering-and-Analysis-Project>
  cd <PANDAS-Jupyter Notebook/COVID-19-ETL-Project.ipynb/>
    
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database:
Follow the instructions in the setup_database.md file to initialize your database.
2. Run ETL Workflow
Execute the ETL script to ingest and transform data into the database:

bash
Copy code
python etl.py
3. Access Data
To view data in a Pandas DataFrame, run:
bash
Copy code
python retrieve_data.py
To access data via API, start the Flask server:
bash
Copy code
flask run
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/data to view the JSON output.
4. Optional User Interaction
If applicable, use the interactive menu to refine data extraction or retrieval processes.

Database Documentation
Type of Database:
The project uses [SQL/NoSQL]. Example:

PostgreSQL for structured data with complex relationships.
MongoDB for unstructured or hierarchical data.
Database Structure:

ERD or schema diagrams are included in the docs/ERD_diagram.png file.
Tables/Collections:
table_1/collection_1: Description
table_2/collection_2: Description
ETL Workflow
The ETL process consists of the following steps:

Extraction:
Retrieve data from [source], such as CSV, APIs, or other datasets.

Transformation:

Data cleaning: Handling missing values, standardizing formats.
Data enrichment: Adding calculated fields or merging datasets.
Loading:
Store the transformed data into the database.

Refer to the ETL diagram in docs/ETL_workflow.png for detailed visuals.

Ethical Considerations
To ensure ethical data handling:

Privacy: Sensitive data is anonymized where necessary.
Bias: Steps have been taken to mitigate data bias during preprocessing.
Transparency: Documentation clearly outlines the data sources and transformation methods.
