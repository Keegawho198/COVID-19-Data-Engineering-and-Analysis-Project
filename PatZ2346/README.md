# COVID-19 Data Engineering and Analysis Project
Purpose of this Project:

The purpose of this project is to perform comprehensive data engineering and analysis on global COVID-19 datasets to derive meaningful insights. This involves cleaning, sorting, and filtering raw datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency, enabling the creation of a structured and actionable new dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths, including global maximums and minimums, while also conducting a detailed examination of Australiaâ€™s data to understand the total cases and deaths in the region.
By applying data engineering techniques and visualizations, the project aims to highlight key patterns and correlations in the data. These insights are intended to support informed decision-making in public health, resource allocation, and pandemic management, demonstrating the value of clean, well-processed data in addressing real-world challenges.

As part of this project, the team addressed the following key analytical questions:
1.    Grouped Analysis:
o    Calculated the sum and mean for new COVID-19 cases and new deaths, grouped by country, to analyze the impact at the national level.
2.    Global Aggregation:
o    Used aggregation techniques to determine the minimum and maximum COVID-19 cases and deaths across the world, offering a global perspective.
3.    Correlation Analysis:
o    Explored the correlation between new cases and new deaths to identify potential relationships between these variables.
4.    Country-Specific Focus (Australia):
o    Filtered the dataset to focus on Australia.
o    Calculated the average, maximum, and minimum for new COVID-19 cases and deaths specifically for Australia.
5.    Data Summarization with Pivot Table:
o    Applied the pivot_table() function to summarize the data efficiently and gain deeper insights.
6.    Exporting Data:
o    Converted the complete cleaned and processed dataset into a new CSV file, ensuring the data is ready for further analysis or reporting.
By addressing these questions, the team applied various data engineering and analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights, demonstrating a robust understanding of real-world data processing and analysis.
